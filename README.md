In this tutorial, I'm going to show you guys , how to build a full-stack web application using Spring FrameWork as Server-Side, and React JS as Client-Side. I'm currently a sophomore majoring in Computer Science at San Jose State University. Since I periodically register for classes, drop classes, and many other features using my school's website for every semester. To mimic that, I come up with an idea of building a similiar website.

Features : Log in , log out , remember-me, create an account , forgot/reset password (send email for verification). Search for classes, register for classes, drop classes, view registered classes, view materials requireds, view profile. Student can download uploaded syllabus from teacher/ instructor. Teacher/ Instructor has an authorization to upload syllabus).

Prerequisites :

Back End : Java core, OOP, basics of data structure such as List, Set, Map. Java Mutithreading (for sending email). Hibernate includes relationship between tables (one to one, one to many, many to one, many to many), bidirectional entity relationship, second level cache (optional). Writing queries is a must. Spirng core (Inverse of Control, Dependency Injection, Annotation, Configuration). Spring Security : Role Authenthication, JWT (understanding of Json Web Token).

Front End : Basics of HTML, CSS, Javascript, and also asynchronous javascript. React Js : Need to be fammiliar in class, functional component. Axios : Calling API from Back End.
